Thus, the diversity crisis is not limited to women, it is about social identities that go beyond gender and race, but it is mainly, about power. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding intersectionality. We posit that a framework can help to incorporate attention to social reproduction of inequities in software engineering by means of the application of the concept to the discipline.", "venue": "2021 IEEE/ACM 13th International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE)", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1398985907", "name": "Mary-Luz S\u00e1nchez-Gord\u00f3n"}, {"authorId": "40622419", "name": "Ricardo Colomo Palacios"}]}, {"paperId": "8c2bf178573a1a1e6900e8222582d68d5c18ecfa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c2bf178573a1a1e6900e8222582d68d5c18ecfa", "title": "What prevents Finnish women from applying to software engineering roles? A preliminary analysis of survey data", "abstract": "Finland is considered a country with a good track record in gender equality. Whilst statistics support the notion that Finland is performing well compared to many other countries in terms of workplace equality, there are still many areas for improvement. This paper focuses on the problems that some women face in obtaining software engineering roles. We report a preliminary analysis of survey data from 252 respondents. These are mainly women who have shown an interest in gaining programming roles by joining the Mimmit koodaa initiative, which aims to increase equality and diversity within the software industry. The survey sought to understand what early experiences may influence later career choices and feelings of efficacy and confidence needed to pursue technology-related careers. These initial findings reveal that women's feelings of computing self-efficacy and attitudes towards software engineering are shaped by early experiences. More negative experiences decrease the likelihood of working in software engineering roles in the future, despite expressing an interest in the field.", "venue": "2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training (ICSE-SEET)", "year": 2020, "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1701595", "name": "A.
