As such, SE is an inherently sociotechnical endeavor on which different social and technical aspects are involved. In fact, it is recognized that successful SE not only depends on technical or process issues, but also it is influenced by human factors. They have been proved to have impact on software process and their study is a growing research field. The summary presented in this chapter highlights the results obtained in a five-year effort research aiming at understanding the role that human factors play in SE. As a result, a holistic view of human factors on software process is given.", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398985907", "name": "Mary-Luz S\u00e1nchez-Gord\u00f3n"}], "citations": [], "references": [{"paperId": "7f131977c4dd03cc48befd254cc1083ccbdb1fe0", "title": "Successful Engagement of Practitioners and Software Engineering Researchers: Evidence From 26 International Industry\u2013Academia Collaborative Projects"}, {"paperId": "e08fafdbe0fdb7fe9ed12e7a88ed14bd104eed35", "title": "Social and Human Factor Classification of Influence in Productivity in Software Development Teams"}, {"paperId": "2e4020217e0837c90915de7a53f79d7e028ccce0", "title": "Factors influencing Software Engineering Career Choice of Andean Indigenous"}, {"paperId": "bda7e892ddbf91beae71da681bc15572f4d1d7d5", "title": "Beyond Technical Skills in Software Testing: Automated versus Manual Testing"}, {"paperId": "26536aede28480e13bfcc5e51ef3dd492c8c6281", "title": "Security as Culture: A Systematic Literature Review of DevSecOps"}, {"paperId": "0e2a612527239dc8ec76a33681b45abb52dd824e", "title": "Development of computational models of emotions: A software engineering perspective"}, {"paperId": "3ffb087b6c88346a98e3f34d42915bc2bcc08b64", "title": "Motivation and Satisfaction of Software Engineers"}, {"paperId": "2ad093d3e71644fb3487fb69d5240209ffa151a4", "title": "Closing the Gap Between Software Engineering Education and Industrial Needs"}, {"paperId": "a1472a8ad057a4fd598ed31aede047947da9f15f", "title": "Next-Generation Software Testers: Broaden or Specialize!"}, {"paperId": "db181848ddc0790541bb1baa14016e20208caf15", "title": "Immigrant stereotypes and differential screening"}, {"paperId": "8f53ebe5981c1fdb9d779a761513195250a43fd4", "title": "Taking the emotional pulse of software engineering - A systematic literature review of empirical studies"}, {"paperId": "238e37a5d19c7cd4941555cd0f031e0e3afc913f", "title": "Developing SPI Culture in the SME Arena: An Exploratory Study"}, {"paperId": "b832e13df105e0696227dcfda3e03750c0410b67", "title": "The skills that employers look for in software testers"}, {"paperId": "22005fb97f4b129755bdd8b62e80f9a9a94c3a34", "title": "A Systematic Mapping Study of Diversity in Software Engineering: A Perspective from the Agile Methodologies"}, {"paperId": "1d676b25b9b1fbc009b64231fb5092feeca3b640", "title": "A Global View on the Hard Skills and Testing Tools in Software Testing"}, {"paperId": "06f038a50d9bde889c0bd300cff042d63d6b5ebb", "title": "A Systematic Mapping Study on Soft Skills in Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "79cf6bc3b42f7d6cf03ae68773dbd8b9179a9319", "title": "Characterizing DevOps Culture: A Systematic Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "1fc7c03956ddf0850e870d97ac6d56fc597f3b51", "title": "Global Software Development: Practices for Cultural Differences"}, {"paperId": "6b87a920241c5dc936ab7fe922fc255c9ace7a62", "title": "50 Years of Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "33228bb7c9df7e0f5bf5c05f0655d6b9c4fca4e1", "title": "On Gender, Ethnicity, and Culture in Empirical Software Engineering Research"}, {"paperId": "edaaa15782960cde837028730ffc6efac3cec06e", "title": "Diversity in Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "a3ca6e48d7653babc39c9b2d61731bd3e86f587e", "title": "A standard-based framework to integrate software work in small settings"}, {"paperId": "d9948070801e684403ecfcb51b6d5fcf53a7ebf4", "title": "The Impact of Situational Context on the Software Development Process - A Case Study of a Highly Innovative Start-up Organization"}, {"paperId": "6487ea3275f532b50b55d6cd41813512fc12d7b9", "title": "DevSecOps: A Multivocal Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "50b2a0672851e0aaf73ef2c1289c16fb7c479a10", "title": "Cultural Influences on Collaborative Work in Software Engineering Teams"}, {"paperId": "c9c4aa59895ecd407d6d5894e48870eeeb3fe404", "title": "Getting the Best out of People in Small Software Companies: ISO/IEC 29110 and ISO 10018 Standards"}, {"paperId": "cb4ddaba6676f0a281e263cfe09493a0bf4171d2", "title": "Relationship of DevOps to Agile, Lean and Continuous Deployment - A Multivocal Literature Review Study"}, {"paperId": "57922882374e6766aef325e5bd8b9eb9f5d21df5", "title": "Software Architecture in a Changing World"}, {"paperId": "8b59d5077564c59a9b1211fbd4b65123587e84da", "title": "Gamification and Human Factors in Quality Management Systems: Mapping from Octalysis Framework to ISO 10018"}, {"paperId": "f0fadd931fdf9be58cfd8b60d767ebbda057a8b0", "title": "Bridging the Gap Between SPI and SMEs in Educational Settings: A Learning Tool Supporting ISO/IEC 29110"}, {"paperId": "1f8385e78b1d20daa94f3177ccb702af85c781b8", "title": "A Learning Tool for the ISO/IEC 29110 Standard: Understanding the Project Management of Basic Profile"}, {"paperId": "5d2542bd3d0aaa972fda38494a2da1fd11a3a1fb", "title": "How Do Black Men Succeed in IT Careers?
