Despite various efforts to increase diversity and multi-gendered participation, women are even more underrepresented in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. In my Ph.D., I investigate the following question: How can OSS communities increase women's participation in their projects? I will identify different OSS career pathways and develop a holistic view of women's motivations to join or leave OSS, as well as their definitions of success. Based on this empirical investigation, I will work together with the Linux Foundation to design attraction and retention strategies focused on women. Before and after implementing the strategies, I will conduct empirical studies to evaluate the state of the practice and understand the implications of the strategies.", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1859526", "name": "Bianca Trinkenreich"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4e008928d269e482c3b080d6a7fed174df14736d", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"]}, {"paperId": "6864641517b4e59097712e639e44d2efed92e14e", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"]}, {"paperId": "4d6d1dae2f4a54ae14f35ec92d9f247a3b115064", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"]}], "references": [{"paperId": "7694806baedd360510999a1fa357429294168cf9", "title": "Gender Differences in Public Code Contributions: A 50-Year Perspective"}, {"paperId": "fae25af60bf3d25841f32731333894beb173d900", "title": "Hidden Figures: Roles and Pathways of Successful OSS Contributors"}, {"paperId": "320d15f122046a235c72ca739fef2b46b5d0f86a", "title": "Gender, diversity, and inclusion in open source communities"}, {"paperId": "c2c7fd869207bd0d89fe0d38c3eb92bae7ad4881", "title": "Physics PhDs Ten Years Later: Success Factors and Barriers in Career Paths.
