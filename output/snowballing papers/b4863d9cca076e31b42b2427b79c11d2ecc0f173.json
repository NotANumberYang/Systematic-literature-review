Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses. This paper describes a course focused on a combination of teaching methodologies, educational robotics tools, and a student learning management methodology, all within an inclusive framework to strengthen the presence of women and other under-represented groups in engineering.", "year": 2020, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "authors": [{"authorId": "51436809", "name": "Pedro Plaza"}, {"authorId": "123591583", "name": "M.
