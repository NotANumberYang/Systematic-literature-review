The discussions about gender diversity in Software Engineering are on the table; however, which are the benefits and the difficulties people in software development teams see in gender diversity? For this work, we conducted a survey to qualitatively understand the perceived benefits and difficulties of gender diversity in software development teams. We found out that gender-diverse workplaces are prone to have better ideas sharing, better decision making, creativity, and innovation. Respondents mentioned that some companies worked to improve the hiring process to be more gender-inclusive. Women\u2019s support and inspiration were shared, and some men reported being touched by the subject and diligently are deconstructing their prejudice and misconceptions about women in technology. There are also difficulties. It is common to see only one woman in teams or just a few. More than that, no other gender than men and women, so the white, cisgender man is the pattern most of the time. The same pattern repeats itself in leadership positions leading to male protectionism and privileges. Additionally, other dimensions of diversity pervaded the answers, like intersectionality, race/ethnicity, ageism, and a less explored point: social vulnerability.", "year": 2022, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Review"], "authors": [{"authorId": "51241982", "name": "Karina Kohl"}, {"authorId": "1782810", "name": "Rafael Prikladnicki"}], "citations": [], "references": [{"paperId": "9320893f6d5740730e45119c80808b2100cd213e", "title": "A Framework for Intersectional Perspectives in Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "61e067b2b2f4beef1bd1d0b4db0c31abc41408be", "title": "\"You Sound Like a Good Program Manager\": An Analysis of Gender in Women's Computing Life Histories"}, {"paperId": "1df6e578fc40d3a8bb4feea361eb3d4eb160cbb7", "title": "Impact of Affirmative Action on Female Computer Science/Software Engineering Undergraduate Enrollment"}, {"paperId": "f27cfba8f54d0d03358ec961d68e2a35dafb3a9f", "title": "Closing the Gender Gap in Engineering: Students Role Model Program"}, {"paperId": "a1aae68e47bbced57022d11368a7d15b2e4a45c0", "title": "Egalitarian men: stereotypes and discrimination in the labor market"}, {"paperId": "1ec4eb7350602d8b0608da65eb6955dffaee524d", "title": "Emotion regulation and empathic abilities in young adults: The role of attachment styles"}, {"paperId": "45b66005c21e6c105f4483d349f3ca9c28b432c5", "title": "Gender Diversity and Community Smells: Insights From the Trenches"}, {"paperId": "550ad23766eee470fada4f3f5690aecb67f4e21d", "title": "Nuancing the discourse of underrepresentation: a feminist post-structural analysis of gender inequality in computer science education in the US"}, {"paperId": "33da59c4705b2ffdc3995d90be096cf010b7b58e", "title": "Gender in Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "460156ec0505cd073df49c4c4c2fc56643555292", "title": "Sentiment and Emotion in Software Engineering"}, {"paperId": "29bf302983b5a4bd8c1b75c8af02afca78dc45ed", "title": "Diversity and Inclusion in Open Source Software (OSS) Projects: Where Do We Stand?"}, {"paperId": "2d44752bddc3fcbf5d695a44a3c1ad394c00b618", "title": "How Remote Work Can Foster a More Inclusive Environment for Transgender Developers"}, {"paperId": "93ff0911b8762433b3b3e8fe2bd00f57a1aae1c0", "title": "Implicit Gender Biases in Professional Software Development: An Empirical Study"}, {"paperId": "854e16d002bd80e81a12204a649d91ec522adc45", "title": "Gender Diversity and Women in Software Teams: How Do They Affect Community Smells?"}, {"paperId": "f7ca88f6a9b0a6827d63e36ce2b576bc0ab4b962", "title": "The Promise of Empathy: Design, Disability, and Knowing the \"Other\""}, {"paperId": "a7662f2232d3da3a7ab6307d4d7a411bccf14f11", "title": "Investigating the Effects of Gender Bias on GitHub"}, {"paperId": "460a591048d883cff9008f163a50bf54609b2b54", "title": "OpenStack Gender Diversity Report"}, {"paperId": "51b502b9ce774a615474ed8629e74d0dfaa33ee3", "title": "The ABC of Software Engineering Research"}, {"paperId": "074b54ce7a5045fd7072fd5d6bed01bd45a18dbc", "title": "Perceptions on Diversity in Brazilian Agile Software Development Teams: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "86d975af12b8ceb829f208fe19fd7b9533ff55e8", "title": "Motivated empathy: a social neuroscience perspective."}, {"paperId": "a600294061e2cfa16621d278a7b86c5a47d48d20", "title": "Do Programmers Work at Night or During the Weekend?"}, {"paperId": "7e83b4036200f7fe1cbcd663862fb6609ec46ba4", "title": "What happens when software developers are (un)happy"}, {"paperId": "ea91b537a8ad56bae0737161613a7b928a1fd741", "title": "The gender of opponents: Explaining gender differences in performance and risk-taking?"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "To achieve gender equality, we must first tackle our unconscious biases"}, {"paperId": "5fff39b0c71e3b32cad88d8bd1e430b014624235", "title": "Empathy Map as a Tool to Analyze Human-Computer Interaction in the Elderly"}, {"paperId": "0fd60a648567a04f87dfdcddbd93d86de26e45fe", "title": "Female Leadership in Software Projects: A Preliminary Result on Leadership Style and Project Context Factors"}, {"paperId": "55784f9df1041c8204bb25d8af3455eae1cfbde8", "title": "Work\u2013family Conflict, Family\u2013work Conflict and Intention to Leave the Organization: Evidences Across Five Industry Sectors in India"}, {"paperId": "b1d8ca204370bc8f74457c9c807418d6564f379f", "title": "Code of conduct in open source projects"}, {"paperId": "b4b528e5c02516e9296b96cf2e719a0d9f112877", "title": "Consequences of Unhappiness while Developing Software"}, {"paperId": "3e2a02bba3941ccd97087ec0c4149575fafca016", "title": "How Meritocracy is Defined Today?
