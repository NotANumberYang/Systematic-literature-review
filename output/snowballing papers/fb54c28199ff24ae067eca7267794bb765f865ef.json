Beginning during preschool years, males consistently spend more time than females in computing activities. For males, such concentrated involvement translates into higher achievement scores in computer-based technology in both academic and career settings. The outcome for females is an inequitable chance to acquire the same technological skill levels as males. An analysis of research findings reveals that social interactions among children, their families and schools can affect attitudes and motivation of children in very different ways according to gender. Eighteen unique factors which have a significant impact on the formation of this discrepancy are identified. Recommendations for further research studies to examine and bridge the existing technological gender gap are made.", "year": 1991, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "authors": [{"authorId": "69858432", "name": "C.
