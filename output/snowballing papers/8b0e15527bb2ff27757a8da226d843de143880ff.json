This perception can exclude a variety of individuals with a diverse set of skills and backgrounds, in turn helping exacerbate the current diversity & inclusion imbalance in OSS. Because one\u2019s perspective of success can affect one\u2019s personal, professional, and life choices, to support a diverse class of individuals we must first understand how OSS contributors understand success. Thus far, research has used a uni-dimensional, code-centric lens to define success. In this paper, we challenge this status quo to reveal OSS contributors\u2019 multifaceted definitions of success. We do so through interviews with 27 OSS contributors whose communities recognize them as successful, and a follow-up open survey with 193 OSS contributors. Our study provides nuanced definitions of success perceptions in OSS, which might help devise strategies to attract and retain a diverse set of contributors, helping them attain their unique \u201cpot of gold at the end of the rainbow\u201d.", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1859526", "name": "Bianca Trinkenreich"}, {"authorId": "1999402349", "name": "M.
