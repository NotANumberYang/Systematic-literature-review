The goal of this work is to find Association Rules between gender characteristics and coding using the Apriori Algorithm. A total of 61 association rules were generated through the aforementioned algorithm, being 22 of them found only in the data set with the women, 24 found only with the men, and 15 applicable to both sets. We can cite as one of the main findings of this work the fact that the representativeness of women in GSoC is decreasing in the last few years. Despite this, the representativeness of women in GSoC is above average, according to what has been reported in other studies in the literature in which women are underrepresented. When it comes to the most utilized technologies, we have \u201cPython\", \u201cJava\", \u201cC++\", \u201cC\" and \u201cJavaScript\" in the top. Analyzing technologies, it\u2019s possible to realize that the main utilized technologies for men and women are similar, but, in general, men are more likely linked to programming languages. The most common project topics are: \u201cEvent Management\", \u201cWeb\", \u201cWeb Development\", \u201cData Science\" and \u201cCloud\" in the top. This can represent how diverse the project topics of the database are, but not necessarily has something related to gender.", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2034285298", "name": "Jhemeson Silva Mota"}, {"authorId": "2123917262", "name": "Marcio Vinicius Okimoto"}, {"authorId": "9208870", "name": "Edna Dias Canedo"}, {"authorId": "2123917265", "name": "Jhonatan Silva Mota"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4e008928d269e482c3b080d6a7fed174df14736d", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"]}], "references": [{"paperId": "5022492a9ad08cae031f66afb7d010577c2a4b3a", "title": "Gender Diversity in Computer Science at a Large Research University"}, {"paperId": "09cd08e9d24bfbab72e737b61d229050c8f17cac", "title": "Google Summer of Code: Student Motivations and Contributions"}, {"paperId": "11e6873f21708d131048ebe8d77d07ca2df986fe", "title": "The Decision Maker's Handbook to Data Science: A Guide for Non-Technical Executives, Managers, and Founders"}, {"paperId": "29bf302983b5a4bd8c1b75c8af02afca78dc45ed", "title": "Diversity and Inclusion in Open Source Software (OSS) Projects: Where Do We Stand?"}, {"paperId": "09efda22beeb27bc1c30717902fc20e20eb3a728", "title": "How the Academics Qualification Influence the Students Learning Development"}, {"paperId": "3e2751ea8e904579a488f57fa9a81f539df88733", "title": "FLOSS Participants' Perceptions About Gender and Inclusiveness: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "e3e2ebf973741456386e9602063a2d1885a7108d", "title": "Going Farther Together: The Impact of Social Capital on Sustained Participation in Open Source"}, {"paperId": "6966463e766e2d546ecb4ee486a5f56f129f1a88", "title": "Perceptions of Gender Diversity's Impact on Mood in Software Development Teams"}, {"paperId": "0c6ae1130f33cf9eff5772db8e1f616cd9967eff", "title": "Computer Science Educators Stack Exchange: Perceptions of Equity and Gender Diversity in Computer Science"}, {"paperId": "3fac69b8385c5f57978a43b060a6437bd1ea945b", "title": "Gender Diversity in STEM Disciplines: A Multiple Factor Problem"}, {"paperId": "460a591048d883cff9008f163a50bf54609b2b54", "title": "OpenStack Gender Diversity Report"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Google diversity annual report"}, {"paperId": "700cee9acdf321b148e84c87376a153f04f4afec", "title": "Why there is still few women in Engineering?
