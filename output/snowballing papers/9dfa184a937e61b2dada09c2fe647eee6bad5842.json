Studies within this field not only report insignificant improvement in the proportion of women in Western countries\u2019 computing fields but also alert us of a declining trend. Moreover, that decline has been accompanied \u2013 or even preceded \u2013 by years of research and programs that have specifically focused on increasing women\u2019s participation in computing; however, they have not had the expected effect. More surprisingly, there has been a significant increase in the representation of women in all other science-related fields and professions. Our aim is to provide some clues to fight the feeling of inexorability that may be entailed by the research on women in computing. We will argue that part of the problem is related to the static nature of the research deployed around the problem of \u2018women in computing\u2019, primarily, the research constructed around the \u2018leaky pipeline\u2019 metaphor. We provide a synthesis of the critiques this research has received in recent decades and highlight research trends that render other landscapes visible when studying \u2018women in computing\u2019. These trends help us question how we are conducting research within this field and urge us to problematise assumptions about computing and gender that we may paradoxically continue to reproduce even while denouncing the paucity of women in computing and studying the reasons for this state of affairs. In short, we present the need for different researchers\u2019 eyes that allow different landscapes of women and computing to be seen and produced.", "year": 2016, "publicationTypes": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "107773516", "name": "A.
