Real-world teams are ever-mindful of the practicalities of adding new methods on top of their existing processes. For example, how can they keep the time costs viable? How can they maximize impacts of using it? What about controversies that can arise in talking about gender? To find out how software teams \u201cin the trenches\u201d handle these and similar questions, we collected the GenderMag-based processes of 10 real-world software teams\u2014more than 50 people\u2014for periods ranging from 5 months to 3.5 years. We present these teams' insights and experiences in the form of 9 practices, 2 potential pitfalls, and 2 open issues, so as to provide their insights to other real-world software teams trying to engineer gender-inclusivity into their software products.", "year": 2020, "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3913620", "name": "C.
