Thus, the interest of the research community in identifying who is contributing to a project has increased in the last years. In the software domain, and although other types of diversity exist, this is particularly important for the case of gender. Given the large amount of publicly available data on the software development process that can be retrieved and analyzed from the Internet (e.g., GitHub, StackOverflow), the importance of having methods and tools that help to identify the participation of women within large amounts of data is desirable. In this paper we present a free software tool, called damegender, which we have conceived to infer the gender from the name of a participant. damegender is based on open databases from official census and uses Machine Learning. An experimental branch is currently under development for those cases where instead of names we have diminutives or nicknames. We have compared damegender with other name-togender inference tools, obtaining good results. We hope the damegender tool can become a cornerstone for the scientific advancement of the study of gender (including the gender gap) and diversity in Information Technology (IT), Copyright c \u00a9 by the paper\u2019s authors.
