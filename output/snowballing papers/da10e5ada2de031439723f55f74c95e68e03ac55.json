Methods: The computer self efficacy scale was modified to make it applicable for clinical settings (for use with older people or people with disabilities using everyday technologies). The modified scale was piloted, then tested with patients in an Australian inpatient rehabilitation setting (n\u2009=\u200988) to determine the internal consistency using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient. Construct validity was assessed by correlation of the scale with age and technology use. Factor analysis using principal components analysis was undertaken to identify important constructs within the scale. Results: The modified computer self efficacy scale demonstrated high internal consistency with a standardised alpha coefficient of 0.94. Two constructs within the scale were apparent; using the technology alone, and using the technology with the support of others. Scores on the scale were correlated with age and frequency of use of some technologies thereby supporting construct validity. Conclusions: The modified computer self efficacy scale has demonstrated reliability and construct validity for measuring the self efficacy of older people or people with disabilities when using everyday technologies. This tool has the potential to assist clinicians in identifying older patients who may be more open to using new technologies to maintain independence. Implications for Rehabilitation Technology is playing an increasing role in supporting older people or people with disabilities to function safely and independently in their own home. Assessment tools that are able to predict those people that are more likely to successfully adopt new technologies will be useful to clinicians. A modified version of the computer self efficacy scale appears to be a promising way of measuring technology self efficacy in a clinical rehabilitation population.", "year": 2012, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2101815", "name": "K.
