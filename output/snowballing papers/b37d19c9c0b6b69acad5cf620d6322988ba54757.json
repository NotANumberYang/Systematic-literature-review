They include: Curriculum & Pedagogy, Business Model & Value Proposition, Increasingly Diverse Student Body, and Student Success & Completion. These strategic issues are those in which faculty have the ability to provide the most influence and make the most impact; areas in which the faculty can make significant contributions without requiring higher-level organizational commitment. In addition, attention to these four areas can help to address the shortage of individual entry-level employees in the field. The paper does not offer prescriptive solutions; rather, it broadly frames some strategic issues and suggests areas for stakeholder consideration. Ideally, each program should weigh strategic issues against the backdrop of the environmental factors, i.e., opportunities and threats, within which it operates, and in the context of its own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, each program should consider its own relevant strategic issues from the perspective of its mission, values, and aspirations.", "year": 2019, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "authors": [{"authorId": "66420894", "name": "Bruce Saulnier"}, {"authorId": "52356907", "name": "Wendy Ceccucci"}, {"authorId": "72133490", "name": "P.
