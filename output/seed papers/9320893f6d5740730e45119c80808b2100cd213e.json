Thus, the diversity crisis is not limited to women, it is about social identities that go beyond gender and race, but it is mainly, about power. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding intersectionality. We posit that a framework can help to incorporate attention to social reproduction of inequities in software engineering by means of the application of the concept to the discipline.", "year": 2021, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1398985907", "name": "Mary-Luz S\u00e1nchez-Gord\u00f3n"}, {"authorId": "40622419", "name": "Ricardo Colomo Palacios"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "78925cc812f4e0106ff5b1c5cbd33fe6bbd13fde", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"]}], "references": []}
